# Book_Club
<p>This repository houses the code for the website hosted at <a href=www.mybookclub.tech>www.mybookclub.tech</a>.</p>
<p>I created the basic template for this as a project for a college course, and I have been working on improving it and adding features and functionality.</p>
<p>This site is built using Flask for the backend and HTML+CSS front-end.
<p>Credits to Miguel Grinberg, author of 
<a href=https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world>The New and Improved Flask Mega-Tutorial</a>, 
which I used to create the basic site structure.</p>
